# taskflow
Collaborative project management app

#Development Notes
Keep frontend and backend files segregated. All frontend code belongs in taskflow/frontend all server source code belongs in taskflow/server, and all other code belongs in taskflow/

For production:
/frontend npm run build to build client code from source
remove frontend/.gitignore /build to push built react app
